                      The data displayed on Skymap.com is typically 30 seconds delayed from real-time. Maps animate the aircraft position toward the last known position. An aircraft's position on the map may lag real-time by 1-2 minutes.

                      Generally, different information is relevant for people tracking commercial flights versus people tracking GA flights. For example, to commercial travelers, the time a flight leaves and arrives at a gate is usually more important than the time the aircraft lands on the runway. This is also what is printed on airline tickets. For GA flights, the summary section is condensed so that the map is more visible on the page without scrolling.<br /><br />
                      For commercial flights we show:<br />
                      The time a flight leaves and arrives at the gate, when available ("in" and "out" times). This is what is printed on airline tickets.<br />
                      Three-letter airport codes by default.<br />
                      The city and country of the origin and destination airports.<br />
                      The airline's logo.<br /><br />
                      For general-aviation flights, we show:<br />
                      The time a flight takes off from and lands on the runway ("off" and "on" times).<br />
                      A photograph of the aircraft, or an aircraft of the same type, when available.<br />
                      The summary section is condensed and moved to the top right so that the map is more visible on the page without scrolling.

                    Why does scheduled landing time occur after scheduled gate arrival time?

                      SkyMap receives airline schedules months in advance of the flight. Occasionally, the scheduled gate time will not change leading up to departure, even though there may be a departure or arrival delay causing the scheduled landing time to occur after the scheduled gate arrival time.
